Runtime Options
===============

Char has a large number of runtime options that drive how it performs.  You can obtain the 
following information by using the ``--help`` option::

    Usage: char [options] confchar

    Options:
      -h, --help        show this help message and exit
      -v, --verbose     Gives extra info while running.
      -i, --input       Makes the transport calculation input deck.
      -r, --run         Run the transport calculation.
      -d, --dry-run     Dry Run. Do NOT run the transport calculation.
      -a, --analyze     Run analysis on database.
      -b, --burnup      Run the burnup calculation.
      -x, --xs          Run the cross-section generation calculation.
      -m, --delta-mass  Run the initial isotope sensitivity calculation.
      -c, --clean       Cleans the reactor direactory of current files.
      -l, --local       Run or Fetch files locally.
      -s, --server      Run or Fetch files from a remote server.
      -f, --fetch       Fetches files from the remote server. Does not run
                        transport, even if -r is set. Automatically sets -s.
      -p, --pid         Finds the process identification number of a current
                        transport run. Sets -d.
      -k, --kill        Kills the current transport run. Sets -p.
      --cwd             Run char in the current working directory.
      --ui              Launches the char ui.
      -t, --test        Tests an existing library for soundness.

The ``confchar`` argument is a path to a python file, typically called ``defchar.py`` that is used to 
specify required parameters of char.  The reason that this appears as a runtime argument is because
configuration files can be specified and stored up for different types of reactors, runs, or perturbations.


-------------------------------
Input Generation  (-i, --input)
-------------------------------
This option generates all of the initial input files that are required to perform any transport run.
It initializes the ``{reactor}.h5`` file, which is the cross-section database.


-------------------------------------
Execution (-r, --run) (-d, --dry-run)
-------------------------------------
The run command encapsulates all of the logic on where to execute char (locally or on a server) and 
aggregates all of the run modes (burnup, cross-section generation, and isotopic sensitivity study)
together in a single run command.

If the above run modes are give withough the ``-r`` option, the transport will be run within this process
rather than being subprocessed out appropriately.

On the other hand, the ``-d``  command will set up all required files to run, but skip the actual execution.
This is most useful in debugging.


-------------------
Clean (-c, --clean)
-------------------
Execution typically produces a large number of files.  These mostly come from serpent and other 
inputs that char uses and parses.  However, if you are worried about a previous run interfering 
with the state of a new run, the clean command will remove all previously generated files and ensure
a fresh start.


-----------------------------
Local Execution (-l, --local)
-----------------------------
This command, along with ``-r``, will run char and all of the serpent runs locally.


-------------------------------
Remote Execution (-s, --server)
-------------------------------
This command, along with ``-r``, will run char and all of the serpent runs on a remote server machine.
This server must have serpent and char and all of thier dependnecies installed as well.  The remote 
server information must be specified in the ``confchar`` file.  

This uses ssh and rsync on the backend, so an rsa key is highly recomended.


-----------------------------------
Remote File Retrieval (-f, --fetch)
-----------------------------------
Char provides an easy way to fetch the files that were generated on a remote server via the ``-f`` option.


---------------------------------
Burnup Calculation (-b, --burnup)
---------------------------------
This option runs char in a burnup mode which calculates and stores the isotopic vectors for every 
burnup step, for every perturbation.  This option is typically required before other kinds of 
calculation modes.


-------------------------------------------
Neutron Cross Section Generation (-x, --xs)
-------------------------------------------
The main purpose of char is to calculate neutron cross-sections for various reactor situations.  
This determines whether every isotope in the isotopic tracking list is available in serpent or not.
If it is, then serpent is used to generate cross sections of the reaction types specified.  
If the isotope is not available in the serepent library, then the physical models are used along with a 
high-resolution flux (calculated by serpent) to generate the cross-sections.

This run mode requires that the burnup calculation be run as well.


---------------------------------------------
Isotopic Sensitivity Study (-m, --delta-mass)
---------------------------------------------
Char allows for the inital isotopic vector to be perturbed on a per-isotope basis.
However, in general, pertubing all isotopes in not desirable because most isotopes do 
not have a significant impact on the reactivity of the core.  

Still, for more complex reactors with a large number of input isotopics, determining which 
nuclides to perturb is not immeadiately appearent.  For exmaple, in an typical light water 
reactor, U-235 is the isotope to perturb.  However, in a given fast reactor setup the answer
is less obvious.

The ``-m`` option seeks to rectify this by performing a linear sensitivity study for all 
isotopes to the reactivity of the reactor for all perturbations.  Results are displayed 
as if the ``-a`` analysis option were used.


------------------------
Analysis (-a, --analyze)
------------------------
This mode performs analysis for a previosuly calculated database.

Currently, only the isotopic sensitivity study has an associated analysis mode.  Here 
for each isotope and for each perturbation, the standard deviation of the reactivity 
is calculated for each burn step.  The maximum of standard deviation over all burn steps
and perturbations is takes as the metric for each isotopes.  The isotopes are then sorted 
by this metric.  The higher the value the more likely this isotopes should be incuded as 
a perturbation parameter to the database.  The maximal standard deviation for each isotope
is printed to stdout.


----------------------------------------
Process Discovery and Timing (-p, --pid)
----------------------------------------
This command find the process identity for a given run of char that has already been spwaned.  
This command may work in conjuction with ``-l`` and ``-s`` for local and remote discovery.

Additionally, it prints out the time that the has been spent executing this command.


--------------------------------
Process Termination (-k, --kill)
--------------------------------
This command attempts to kill any currently executing char process.  It may be run 
in conjuction with ``-l`` and ``-s`` for local and remote termination.


---------------------------------
Current Working Directory (--cwd)
---------------------------------
This command executes char within the current working directory, rather than creating a folder 
with the same name as the reactor and execting there.  This option is primarily used in char's
internals, but may be useful for debugging.


-------------------------------
Graphical User Interface (--ui)
-------------------------------
Char comes packaged with a graphical user interface.  Currently, this is used to 
inspect the database library and plot certain types of regular data.

The GUI is based of of the Enthought Tool Suite.  Here is a screenshot, because people love those.

-----------------------------
Database Testing (-t, --test)
-----------------------------
Once the database has been created, it is a good idea to test that its data is valid
before using the file.  To aid in this endevour, you may use the test command to run 
suite of tests on the database itself.  Unlike the other commands, you pass a path 
to the database in as char's aregument, rather than a defchar.py file.  For example::

    char -t /path/to/reactor.h5


================
Common Workflows
================
Below are some comon workflows that are used in to run char in various modes.

Initialize a reactor::

    char -i -c defchar.py


Run a burnup & cross section calculation remotely::

    # Run the reactor
    char -irs -cbx defchar.py

    # Poll the remote server
    char -ps defchar.py

    # After the calculation is complete, get the files
    char -f defchar.py


Run an isotopic sensitivity study and analyze the results::

    char -irl -cm defchar.py
    char -a defchar.py

Start the user interface::

    char --ui

Test the database file::

    char --test /path/to/reactor.h5
